              Satisfied Traditionalists are looking for simple solutions rather
              than technological solutions. Their focus lies more on the
              reliability and dependability and they only have a moderate
              concern with operational cost. In contrast, Efficiency Masters are
              more open to technological solutions and their key concern is
              operational efficiency.

              Correct! Efficiency masters tend to be interested in technological
              solutions that drive efficiency. Though, they typically are not
              early adopters and would like to have the actual impact of the
              technology demonstrated (e.g.in case studies, testimonials, using
              TCO calculators).

              Absentee Operators tend to look more for simple rather than

              their efforts to maximize operational efficiency on other parts of
              their operation. They do not want to put too much energy into the
              purchase process and are not too involved with our product
              portfolio. In contrast, Efficiency Masters are more open to
              technological solutions and their key concern is operational

              Sophisticates are indeed interested in technological solutions.
              However, they tend to be early adopters taking pride using latest
              and greatest technology - rather than employing proven technology
              with the primary benefit of improving operational efficiency.
              Their focus lies more on quality output than operational
              efficiency, which is the key motivation for the Efficiency Master.

              support in comparing offers and for a supplier to stand out from
              the crowd.<br /><br />
              Absentee Operators was the answer we were looking for, as for
              them, our products typically are only “one cog in a big machine”
              of their operations. They look at our products almost as a
              commodity and do not want to put a lot of effort into their
              selection. Therefore, they like working together with a supplier

              is important to ensure a smooth process without any unexpected
              additional loops of reconfiguration or delays, etc. Once we have
              gained a foot in the door and the customer has made good
              experiences with us, we can try to scale to other locations as the
              Absentee Operator typically has the highest number of locations

              Efficiency masters are more dealer than brand-oriented. In
              contrast, the Sophisticates are the most brand-oriented and value
              brands who are able to tailor solutions to their needs. They visit
              tradeshows and want to try out the latest products of brands.

              Absentee Operators do have the fewest number of brands they use
              but it is more a result of valuing the supplier they have worked
              with in the past and who has provided a good experience. In
              contrast, the Sophisticates are the most brand-oriented and value
              brands who are able to tailor solutions to their needs. They visit

              Satisfied Traditionalists are less likely to have a
              strict/formalized selection process. In contrast, the
              Sophisticates typically do. Sophisticates are more likely to be
              businesses with multiple executives as decision makers and tend to
              have a formal supplier selection process. They are looking for a
              true partner as a supplier – thus, once a partnership is
              established, it may not be possible to avoid the formal process
              altogether but to influence the tenders early to best suit their
              needs.
